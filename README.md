### Physical Computing

Physical computing means interacting with real-world objects by programming them from a computer. Examples include: Automatic doors and voice recognition. I like to think of them based on their interactivenes. 

<em> **Learning how to use the [Arduino Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino)** </em>
- Arduino is an open-source hardware and software company, project, and user community that designs and manufactures single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller kits for building digital devices. 

By following this video to [Arduino Education Remote Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgqQDFYqSOY&list=PLT6rF_I5kknMP26rGOy8bDwZs3wbniwU9), I attempted to create a circuit with the board. Since I took physics in GCSEs, I had a foundation knowledge of how circuits work and I think that really helped me for this exercise.

We then tried to increase the amount of light bulbs in the circuit.

**What is an open source (OSS)**

<em>essentially</em>
- computer software that everyone can edit and access it
- the users has the right to use, change, edit the code

<em> defined by Jazmin </em>

Open-source software (OSS) is computer software that is released under a license in which the **copyright holder grants users the rights to use, study, change, and distribute the software and its source code to anyone and for any purpose.** Open-source software may be developed in a **collaborative public manner**. Open-source software is a prominent example of open collaboration, meaning any capable user is able to participate online in development, making the number of possible contributors indefinite. The ability to examine the code facilitates public trust in the software.

__Questions to self:__
**how can the open-source approach be applied to fields outside of computing?** <br> **what does an open-source design project look like?** 

__Definitions:__
[READ.ME](http://READ.ME) file

- first file which the users read
- its a text file that contains the information for the user about the software, project, code, game, or it might contain instructions, help or details about the patches or updates.

[Github](https://github.com/) - Internet hosting platform for software

(I cant figure out how to make these images smaller and side-by-side so this will do...) 

After this exercise in class, it was interesting to watch everyone interact with the piece, erasing, adding, and editing it to create an overall drawing together. I was really interested in what I can do with an Open Source so I did some research! 


### RESEARCH AND INSPIRATIONS

[Open Source Design: Design is the Future of Open Source - Soleio, Combine (Config)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jlt-1E1Ee0&t=824s)
This Youtube video touches on the topic of what type of design initiatives will impact the entire software industry and what can designers learn from the first two decades of the open source software movement. 

[Experiments with Google](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/collection/digitalwellbeing)

After looking through all experimental projects with Google, I was really interested in two of them.

<em> We Flip enables you to switch off from technology as a group, to spend quality time together. Simply wait for everyone to join, then flip the switch together to begin your session. If someone in the group unlocks, the session will end and you'll be able to see how you did. </em>

<em> Activity Bubbles helps you discover what your phone usage looks like in a day. Each unlock creates a new bubble. The longer you stay on your phone the bigger the bubble grows. </em> 

### EXPERIMENTATIONS

I was really inspired by the interface and interactiveness of the program, especially how it is personalised to every user's screentime. Thinking about the sense of community, I had an idea to use the code of this open source program and edit the code so that it creates a "Social bubble" which shows who the users talk to the most and who they should probably catch up with. This idea was meant to enrich our community and to keep up with our friends even though we could be far apart. Personally, I've recently graduated High School and all my friends are now separated in completely different continents in order to study abroad. Although we recognise what an advantage this opportunity is, we often struggle to keep in touch due to time zones and oftentimes are too busy with adjusting to our lives to even reach out to eachother. "Social bubble" would encourage and remind users to keep in touch with others.

After consulting Tigris Li (CreativeComputing GTA), I realised that since the program is designed for mobile apps, the code is very complex due to it's different frameworks and libraries to support it specifically on mobile, it is impossible to achieve this within this week although I would love to attempt this for future projects. Tigris suggested that I could replicate this using p5.js instead.

[Circles Falling](https://editor.p5js.org/zomert1/sketches/B1k0WpG6W) 
I found an existing code of random circles falling, however, they would fall through the canvas and reapear on the top. As seen in the image below: 
<img width="1439" alt="Screenshot 2021-11-25 at 5 18 08 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94901755/143481782-267a8408-8a4c-472e-9a70-e2c8cbc9f24b.png">

This wasn't the affect I was looking for and so I tried to add my own code and commands, learning from different youtube videosand websites. 
(such as...) 
[basics of learning coding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-k-iTUMQAY) 
[learn JavaScript](https://learnjavascript.online/app.html)

I tried altering the code of "Circles Falling" file but it the code wouldn't run and there was a lot of terms that I haven't had the time to learn yet. I then found another p5js file that programs blocks into falling but it wiould stop and pile up at the bottom of the canvas. 

[Fall Blocks](https://editor.p5js.org/lumoconnor/sketches/qZ9gh3c52): I read what each function meant in this code and tried to find what was making the circles from the previous code to loop instead of stop. I realised that it's because the Fall Blocks had a gravity function, I copied and pasted the gravity function onto the circles program but a lot of errors popped up, mostly saying that the variables dont match or theres no function for an action. I tried to edit it so that the language matches, however, that didn't work out after a lot of hours of attempting. 

I then went on youtube to learn [how to code gravity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b7FyIxWW94), tried to code the gravity function for the circles from scratch but more errors appeared and the circles would not move at all, staying at the top of the canvas.

Finally, I realised that I would not have time to finish my desired outcome at all. I'll have to pursue this project further in the future and I would definetely love to do so! Perhaps in a longer duration so I can learn more about coding before developing onto this project. Overall, I learnt a lot about coding in JavaScript as well as writing this Read.Me file. I had some trouble figuring out how to embed photos but I figured it out! This was a fun project.
